## Workflow Orchestration

### Execution Timeline

```
0-45min:  Phase 1 (Parallel)
├── security-auditor: Connection validation (0-30min)
└── security-auditor: CSP hardening (30-45min)

45-65min: Phase 2 (Sequential)
└── dotnet-core-expert: Performance optimization

65-155min: Phase 3 (Parallel with Phase 2 if needed)
└── test-automator: Security service tests

155-185min: Phase 4 (Final)
└── code-reviewer: Validation and sign-off
```

### Coordination Protocols

**Handoff Mechanisms**
1. **Phase 1 → Phase 2**: security-auditor signals completion via status update
2. **Phase 2 → Phase 3**: dotnet-core-expert provides performance baseline
3. **Phase 3 → Phase 4**: test-automator reports coverage metrics
4. **Final Handoff**: code-reviewer validates all changes

**Communication Standards**
- Status updates every 15 minutes during active work
- Immediate notification for blocking issues
- Code commit messages must reference task number
- All agents must run tests before handoff

## Risk Management

### Conflict Prevention
- **File Lock System**: One agent per file at a time
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for each critical fix
- **Merge Protocol**: Sequential merging to prevent conflicts

### Failure Recovery
- **Rollback Plan**: Git tags before each critical change
- **Backup Agent Assignment**: Each primary agent has secondary backup
- **Health Checks**: Application must remain functional after each phase

### Quality Gates
- **Gate 1**: Security fixes pass automated security scan
- **Gate 2**: Performance fix shows measurable improvement
- **Gate 3**: Tests achieve >95% coverage on security services
- **Gate 4**: Final review passes with score >90/100

## Monitoring & Validation

### Real-time Tracking
- **Application Health**: Monitor http://localhost:5002 availability
- **Performance Metrics**: Database query execution times
- **Security Scanning**: Continuous CSP policy validation
- **Test Coverage**: Real-time coverage reporting

### Success Criteria
1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Zero high/critical findings
2. **Performance**: <50ms database save operations
3. **Test Coverage**: >95% on security services
4. **Application Stability**: Zero downtime during fixes
5. **Code Quality**: Final score >90/100

### Reporting Protocol
- **Progress Reports**: Every 30 minutes to orchestrator
- **Issue Escalation**: Immediate for blocking problems
- **Final Report**: Comprehensive summary with metrics
- **Lessons Learned**: Documentation for future orchestrations

## Medium Priority Queue (Post-Critical)

For subsequent coordination after critical fixes:
1. Query caching implementation (dotnet-core-expert)
2. Result pattern implementation (dotnet-core-expert)
3. Configuration extraction (code-reviewer)
4. Health checks addition (test-automator)
