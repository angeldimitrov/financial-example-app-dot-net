- **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern consistently applied
- **Theory/InlineData** for comprehensive scenario coverage
- **Mock objects** for dependency isolation
- **Performance benchmarks** for load validation

### Security Testing Principles:
- **Fail-Secure**: Services default to secure state on errors
